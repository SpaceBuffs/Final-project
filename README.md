# Database:

  Meteor has a database everywhere approach, which means that we have the same  API to query the database on the client as well as on the server. Yet, when we  query the database on the client, we are only able to access the data that we  published to a client.

A Proof of Concept for JPL

GraviTeam
A major difficulty among international scientists is finding a collaborative, social interface where scientists from all over the world can share ideas and design space mission experiments. Our solution is a web based application that uses technology and social media to allow for cross-world communication, design, and experimentation.
